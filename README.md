Practical Questions:
1. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
2. Create a Python function that accepts a string and returns the reverse of that string.
3. Implement a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the squares of each number.
4. Write a Python function that checks if a given number is prime or not from 1 to 200.
5. Create an iterator class in Python that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
6. Write a generator function in Python that yields the powers of 2 up to a given exponent.
7. Implement a generator function that reads a file line by line and yields each line as a string.
8. Use a lambda function in Python to sort a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.
9. Write a Python program that uses `map()` to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

11) Imagine an accounting routine used in a book shop. It works on a list with sublists, which look like this:
Write a Python program, which returns a list with 2-tuples. Each tuple consists of the order number and the product of the price per item and the quantity. The product should be increased by 10,- € if the value of the order is smaller than 100,00 €.
